  "Run this engine's own tests INSIDE wasm32, in chunks.

  A wasm32 module may carry at most 256 typed ABI literals (`browser-host.mjs`
  rejects more with `too many typed ABI literals`). The engine is close enough
  to that ceiling that the build which also carries all 170 test functions --
  each holding its JavaScript source as a string -- goes over it.

  Restricting the EXPORT list does not help, and that is worth stating
  precisely because it is the opposite of how unreachable functions behave:
  measured 2026-08-29, a build that DEFINES 170 tests and exports 3 still
  exceeds the ceiling, while a build that physically contains only those 3
  passes. Function bodies are dropped when unreachable; their literals are
  not.

  So the split is physical: the source is sliced into chunks of test
  functions, each chunk compiled and run on its own.

  Run:  nbb test/wasm-suite.cljs [chunk-size]

  Exit: 0 every test passed, 1 a test failed, 2 the harness could NOT answer
  (no compiler, no host) -- which is not the same as passing and must never
  be read as such."
